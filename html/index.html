			1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

			HTML5 semantic tags are useful because they help to better organize the code and web page layout. When reading through the HTML code, one can clearly read what everything is and how they relate to one another on the page. The ones I see most useful are the headers (h1-h6), the actual header/footer containers, div containers, article containers, anchor tags, and unordered/ordered lists.

			2. What is the order the browser uses to dusplay elements on a page?

			The browser renders a page from top to bottom.

			3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

			We learned how to create Sublime snippets in this challege. Snippets are basically a template one can create to have a base skeleton of an HTML document already made, ready to be filled with content. I actually do see myself creating more snippets in the future as they help eliminate the time wasted on writing boiler code. It will also help me be able to create different web page layouts quicker and I can keep the formats that I like as a snippet.

			4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

			Definitely learning about snippets was the most challenging for me. It's something that was completely new to me before this challenge and it is something that I'm going to need to do more research on to better understand how they work and the scope of their abilities. I can't wait to create more snippets and test their limits.
